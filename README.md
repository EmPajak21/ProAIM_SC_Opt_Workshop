# APS: Supply Chain Optimisation Modelling Workshop
This workshop aims to provide participants with an understanding of mathematical methods for supply chain optimisation, focusing on practical applications in process modelling. Participants will gain knowledge and experience in key topics relevant to supply chain challenges, with an emphasis on mathematical solution methods and practical implementation advice.

### Workshop Overview

- APS: Introduction to Mathematical Optimisation in the Context of Process Modelling.
- APS1: Practical Solutions to the Pooling Problem.
- APS2: Problem Feasibility, Choosing Initial Solutions and Restoration.
- APS3: Solving Large-Scale MI(N)LP Problems.
- APS4: Optimisation under Uncertainty: Stochastic vs Robust.
